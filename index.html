            <h2>Missouri, USA</h2>
            <img src="images/missouri-flag.webp" alt="Missouri Flag">
            <p>Missouri, known as the "Show-Me State," is located in the Midwestern United States and is famous for its rich history, scenic landscapes, and vibrant cities like St. Louis and Kansas City. 
                The state is home to the Gateway Arch, the tallest monument in the United States, and has a strong connection to the Lewis and Clark Expedition. 
                Missouri is also known for its barbecue, jazz music, and the mighty Mississippi River that runs along its eastern border. 
                Additionally, Walt Disney grew up in Missouri, spending much of his childhood in the town of Marceline, which later inspired Main Street, U.S.A., in Disney parks.</p>
